This folder contains the minimum tools required for each MOSCA environment.

When updating a new environment, the following commands should be run from this directory, assigning the correct value for the `ENV_NAME` variable:
`bash
ENV_NAME=env_name
mamba create $ENV_NAME.yml
mamba env export --from-history -f $ENV_NAME.yml > $ENV_NAME.yml
`
