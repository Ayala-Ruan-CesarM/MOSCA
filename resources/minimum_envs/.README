This folder contains the minimum tools required for each MOSCA environment.

When updating a new environment, the following commands should be run from this directory, assigning the correct value for the `ENV_NAME` variable:
`bash
ENV_NAME=env_name
mamba env create $ENV_NAME_min.yaml
conda activate $ENV_NAME
mamba env export --from-history > $ENV_NAME.yaml
`
For a cross-platform export, but which does not bring full versions of the packages, include the `--from-history` flag.
