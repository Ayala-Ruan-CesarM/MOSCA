COG articles
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563889/
-They compared COG composition obtained from their organisms with COG composition of random organisms
    -it revealed a shift towards energy production (more COGs from those categories)

Significant differences
-first, all of the genes significant different through considering the duplicates
-after that, the genes of specific COGs
