Welcome to the Meta-Omics Software for Community Analysis (MOSCA) Pipeline!

This pipeline is a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting meta-omics data, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics. It integrates a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms and visualizations, allowing you to easily and efficiently analyze your data.

#### To get started, check out MOSca's GUI TO perform meta-omics analyses (MOSGUITO):
